## Advanced Programming Sessions @ VandyApps

Are you a Vanderbilt computer science student looking to become a better
programmer? Join us on an 11 week journey towards that goal. We will be
exploring functional programming, monads, promises, typeclasses, and more in
JavaScript and Haskell, and becoming better, smarter programmers in the
process.

Coming Fall 2015.

#### Week 1 - Introduction to functional programming in JavaScript

- Using a REPL.

- Welcome to JavaScript.

- Anonymous functions: Lambdas, closures, lambda lifting.

#### Week 2 - Map / Reduce / Filter / Zip in JavaScript

- Map | Reduce/Fold | Filter | Zip

#### Week 3 - Introduction to Monads

- Note: Use Haskell style type signatures in descriptions without saying what they are.

- Monad laws: Left Identity, Right Identity, Associativity

- Maybe monad

#### Week 4 - Async monad / Promises A+

- Callback hell

- Async monad

- Promises | A+

#### Week 5 - Either Monad

- Left (error) | Right (result)

- How this helps avoid the need for exceptions.

#### Week 6 - Introduction to Programming in Haskell 1

- Installation directions (email out)

- Types

- Writing simple (pure) functions.

- Using the REPL.

- Pattern matching.

#### Week 7 - Introduction to Programming in Haskell 2

- If statements

- Case statements

- Guards

#### Week 8 - Creating Data Types in Haskell

- data

- Recursive types

- Binary tree example.

- type

#### Week 9 - Typeclasses 101

- Type classes.

- Typeclasses are similar to interfaces in OOP.

- Build on binary tree example and use typeclass for its operations.

- BEncoding example.

#### Week 10 - Map / Fold / Filter / Zip in Haskell

- Use them, love them.

- Take a look at their function signatures.

#### Week 11 - Monads in Haskell

- Maybe, Either monads.

- `do` notation.

#### Week 12 - IO in Haskell

- Isn’t it crazy that we’re doing IO last?
