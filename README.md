#### Week 1 - Introduction to functional programming in JavaScript

- Using a REPL.

- Welcome to JavaScript.

- Anonymous functions: Lambdas, closures, lambda lifting.

#### Week 2 - Map / Reduce / Filter / Zip in JavaScript

- Map | Reduce/Fold | Filter | Zip

#### Week 3 - Introduction to Monads

- Note: Use Haskell style type signatures in descriptions without saying what they are.

- Monad laws: Left Identity, Right Identity, Associativity

- Bind, Return, (Optionally) fail

- Maybe monad

#### Week 4 - Async monad / Promises A+

- Async monad

- Promises | A+

#### Week 5 - Either monad

- Left (error) | Right (result)

- How this helps avoid the need for exceptions.

#### Week 6 - Introduction to Programming in Haskell 1

- Installation directions (email out)

- Types

- Writing simple (pure) functions.

- Using the REPL.

- Pattern matching.

#### Week 6 - Introduction to Programming in Haskell 2

- If statements

- Case statements

- Guards

#### Week 7 - Creating Data Types in Haskell

- data vs. newtype vs. type

- Type classes.

- Abstract function signatures.

- Recursive types

- Binary tree example.

#### Week 8 - Typeclasses 101

- Build on binary tree example and use typeclass for its operations.

- Typeclasses are similar to interfaces in OOP.

#### Week 9 - Map / Fold / Filter / Zip in Haskell

- Use them, love them.

- Take a look at their function signatures.

#### Week 10 - Monads in Haskell

- Maybe, Either monads.

- `do` notation.

#### Week 11 - IO in Haskell

- Isn’t it crazy that we’re doing IO last?
